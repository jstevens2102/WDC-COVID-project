# WDC Group Project 2021 - COVID Tracking App

Web & Database Computing final project created in Sem 1 2021. Through this project I learned a lot about HTML/CSS styling as well as integrating database and Javascript functionality into a web application. I also gained some experience working with the Vue.js Javascript framework.

My personal overall mark for this project was 177/180 (scaled up due to positive peer review feedback from group members).
